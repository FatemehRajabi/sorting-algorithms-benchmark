# Sorting Algorithms Benchmark in Java

This project implements and compares the performance of several sorting algorithms in Java:

- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- (Upcoming: Heap Sort, Quick Sort, Modified Quick Sort)

## Goal

To observe how different comparison-based sorting algorithms perform with increasing input sizes on:
- Randomly generated data
- Already sorted data
- Reverse sorted data (coming soon)

## Input Sizes Tested

- 1,000
- 5,000
- 10,000
- 50,000
- 60,000

Each sorting algorithm runs 5 times per input size, and the average execution time is recorded.
